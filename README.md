# CS 370 Final Project

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The purpose of this assignment was to develop the Dppe-Q Learning loop that the agent would use to find the most efficent method through a generated maze utilizing only left, right, up, and down movement options and a reward system.

Almost everything was included for us with the exeption of the loop that would be used to actually train the agent. What we needed to complete was provided to us in the form of pseudocode.  


## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
This course was designed to teach us the similarities between artificial neural networks and biological neural networks and how both learn to accomplish tasks. Specifically, we learned how ANN are trained in the industry and ways that this can be applied to similar projects. In the larger field this can be applied to help humans immensely in the field of data science as ANNs are great at analyzing patterns in data and other such tasks. 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists are problem solvers, they are given a problem in the form of requirements from their company or clients and from those requirements they build a solution in the form of a program or website. This is important, especially in this digital age that we live in because more and more problems will arise as we more and more into the digital space so having the skills of a computer scientist will be more and more important as technology becomes more ingrained in our daily lives.

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
When it comes to creating code for something I tend to start with a pen and paper rough draft. This draft covers all the requirements that the client has asked for. From this draft I break the project down into pieces that can be built upon like Lego bricks. Then I start working one section at a time until I have a working model that can be tested and improved with each iteration.

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
The biggest ethical responsibilities that you have to your end user are to protect them and the data that you are entrusted with. This means implementing proper secure coding protocols and ensuring that bad actors would have a harder time breaking down your software than anothers to discourage them from trying. It is impossible to build a perfect system of security given how many potentially unknown vulnerabilities there are in the dependencies that are used in code all around the world. The best that we can do is to constantly use the most up to date versions and always patching vulnerabilities when they are discovered.
