# CS 370 Final Project

## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
The purpose of this assignment was to develop the Dppe-Q Learning loop that the agent would use to find the most efficent method through a generated maze utilizing only left, right, up, and down movement options and a reward system.

Almost everything was included for us with the exeption of the loop that would be used to actually train the agent. What we needed to complete was provided to us in the form of pseudocode.  


## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
This course was designed to teach us the similarities between artificial neural networks and biological neural networks and how both learn to accomplish tasks. Specifically, we learned how ANN are trained in the industry and ways that this can be applied to similar projects. In the larger field this can be applied to help humans immensely in the field of data science as ANNs are great at analyzing patterns in data and other such tasks. 

## What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

## How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

## What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
